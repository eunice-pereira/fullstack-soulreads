						<h2 class="major">Black Jack</h2>
						<p> This is a simple interactive Black Jack game using Python. It is based on user input into
							the terminal and was
							one of my very first experiences with coding during my software bootcamp program at
							DigitalCrafts in Atlanta.
							I experimented with very basic design by the addition of simple color and emojis within the
							command
							line interface just to
							make it a tad more engaging visually.

						<h2 class="major">Dad Jokes!</h2>
						<p> This was a team effort and my first project where I could stretch my newb UI legs a bit! We
							built an API based application focused solely on Front-End development.
							It was constructed from the use of two APIs a joke simulator and an avatar simulator. All
							the team members contributed to mulitple tasks, however my primary role was
							was developing the design and feature aspects of this app. This was a fun one for sure!</p>

						<p> SoulReads is an online book club built with React and Express. It allows for members to keep
							an online library and book journal,
							and also allows for member interaction through a public member forum. This was a complete
							Full-Stack application developed by a team of myself and two other
							amazing women! My primary role was constructing our entire front-end with ReactJS,
							developing everything from the components, to the visual conception/layout,
							and the full visual design. This project was completed in terms of a capstone presentation,
							but will continue to be fully developed and pushed to market.

					<h2 class="major">Stepping stones...</h2>
					<p>My time at DigitalCrafts Atlanta was definitely a major stepping stone for me! I've learnerd
						full-stack development
						in the course of 16 intensive weeks! Here shortly I'll also be wrapping up my Bachelor's Degree
						in Software Engineering,
						which will accompany my Google IT Support certification and Navy computer tech background.
						Needless to say I am passionate
						about what I do. Coding is an endless world of creativity and it is responsible for every
						experience we have in our lives today
						when you really think about. To learn and work in a field that allows for such an impact is
						truly exciting!

							<p>I'm based in Virgina Beach, VA and am originally from California. In the Navy I served as
								a SSDS technician maintaining
								computer systems controlling weapons and radars onboard. After the Navy, I went to
								school for film and graphic design, but
								my love technology found it's way back to the forefront when discovered that I could
								mesh graphic design with Front-End development
								and now here I am incorporating them all! Please feel to connect with me as I'd love to
								expand my network and grow through opportunity!
