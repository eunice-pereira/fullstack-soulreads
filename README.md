# SoulReads

SoulReads is an online book club which allows members to keep a digital book journal and share ideas through posts with fellow members.

## Summary

SoulReads is a full-stack development project we designed to incorporate an API call from Google Books. Users can search and add books to their booklist from the API or manually enter them. Members can also post on a private journal or our public forum "Soul Chat". On SoulChat users can add a post, communicate with each other, and post pictures. The journal is for members to privately express their feelings on a particular book.
