# SoulReads

## 📚 Summary

SoulReads is an online book club built with React and Express. It allows for members to keep an online library and book journal, and also allows for member interaction through a public member forum. 

##😍 Inspiration 

Simply, we love to read! We found a common interest mainly in spiritual, self-transformation, cosmic, elevating books, which inspired our name 😌 While recommending books to one another, we were inspired to begin building an online book club where we could connect with other people. 

## 💡Features 

- API call from Google Books, allowing members to search and add books to their persoal library or manually enter them. 
- Members can keep private journal entries for books stored in their library to keep track of their insights and learning moments. 
- The member forum, SoulChat, encourages interaction between like-minded readers. 
- Members are able to search and share for books from their personal library, and post thoughts or insights on the book. 
- Once shared, fellow members are able to add comments to begin a discussion.
